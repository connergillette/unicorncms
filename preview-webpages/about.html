                        I am a third-year student at the University of Washington. I grew up in Sammamish, Washington and went to Skyline High School, where I co-founded and co-captained (and in 2017, coached) the Ultimate Frisbee Club. I like playing Dota and learning new skills
                        in my free time. I consider myself a quick learner and easily self-motivated to learn new skills and be productive.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> Ever since I was a little kid I've loved working with computers and learning about different ways to use them. In elementary school I taught myself how to program in C / C++, and in middle school I started looking at C++
                        and HTML / CSS.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Lately I've been exploring interests in web design and web app development, and my work at <a href="http://seattlewebdesign.com" class="highlight" target="_blank">efelle creative</a> has helped hone my skills in that area.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>Since the fall of 2016, the Dota club at UW has been my main extracurricular project. It has since grown into a partnership with the <a class="highlight" href="https://www.facebook.com/wgauw/">Washington Gaming Association</a>                        and three competitive teams (one of which is affiliated with <a class="highlight" href="https://www.facebook.com/uwesports/">Washington eSports</a>). I'm very proud of how far the club has gone, and am working to make the club
                        better for as many Dota players as possible.
                        <br/>
                        <br/> I constantly like to be learning new things, whether it be something that will help me academically, in my career, or in general. I hope to pursue opportunities in the future that will help me grow as a person and do meaningful
                        work in the process.
